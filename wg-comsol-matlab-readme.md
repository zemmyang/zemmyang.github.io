<h1 id="usage">Usage</h1>
<p>Open a Comsol-linked Matlab window by running</p>
<pre><code>comsol mphserver matlab
</code></pre>
<p>in the command line.</p>
<h1 id="notes">Notes</h1>
<p>3D simulations uses Direct PARDISO solvers instead of the suggested Iterative solver. This reduces simulation time, but requires a lot of RAM.</p>
