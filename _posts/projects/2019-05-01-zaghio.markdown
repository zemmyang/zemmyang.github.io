Using the [Freelancer theme by jeromelachaud](https://github.com/jeromelachaud/freelancer-theme), [also here](http://jeromelachaud.com/freelancer-theme/), I extended the features to include support for multiple sets of projects, a timeline (as seen in the Education section), and changed the colors a bit.
