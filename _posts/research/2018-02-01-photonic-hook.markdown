description: This paper investigates the movement of nanoparticles under the influence
  of a curved electric field generated by an asymmetric dielectric cuboid.
abstract: Specialized electromagnetic fields can be used for nanoparticle manipulation
  along a specific path, allowing enhanced transport and control over the particle’s
  motion. In this paper, we investigate the optical forces produced by a curved photonic
  jet, otherwise known as the “photonic hook”, created using an asymmetric cuboid.
  In our case, this cuboid is formed by appending a triangular prism to one side of
  a cube. A gold nanoparticle immersed in the cuboid’s transmitted field moves in
  a curved trajectory. This result could be used for moving nanoparticles around obstacles;
  hence we also consider the changes in the photonic hook’s forces when relatively
  large glass and gold obstacles are introduced at the region where the curved photonic
  jet is created. We show, that despite the obstacles, perturbing the field distribution,
  a particle can move around glass obstacles of a certain thickness. For larger glass
  slabs, the particle will be trapped stably near it. Moreover, we noticed that a
  partial obstruction of the photonic jet’s field using the gold obstacle results
  in a complete disruption of the particle’s trajectory.
