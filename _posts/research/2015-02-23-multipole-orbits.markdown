description: This thesis expands the Kepler problem of graviational orbits by considering the additional multipole moments of a non-spherically symmetric attractor.
abstract: In the Kepler Problem, it is assumed that the attractor and the orbiting body to be both point particles. In this paper, we removed this assumption for the attractor and assume that it has a shape. To do this, we derived the general form of the additional terms in the multipole expansion. Specifically, we look at the quadrupole moment of a gravitating body and used this as the approximation of our extended body. Using analytical methods, we were able to show that only the the z-component of the angular momentum vector remains constant, and that orbits starting at the equatorial or azimuthal plane stay on a single plane. We also used numerical methods to show that the orbit varies as the initial conditions approach the attractor.

* studied the related works in literature about gravitational potentials, orbits, and numerical methods for solving differential equations. wrote the thesis text, summarized and drew conclusions from the results from the simulations
*  adapted the code, in **FORTRAN 90**, for the second-order Runge-Kutta method for solving the differential equation obtained from the orbit calculations, generated and post-processed roughly 10 billion datapoints
* created the illustrations for the text in **AutoCAD 2010**. plotted the numerical simulation results using **gnuplot**, a command-line driven plotting utility for Linux systems
* presented the results in front of a panel of four professors in the Physics Department
