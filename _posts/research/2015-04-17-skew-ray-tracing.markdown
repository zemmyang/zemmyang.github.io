description: This work shows a purely analytical method for calculating the skew
  3D light rays confined inside an optical fiber.
abstract: 'We used geometric algebra to compute the paths of skew rays in a cylindrical,
  step-index multimode optical fiber. To do this, we used the vector addition form
  for the law of propagation, the exponential of an imaginary vector form for the
  law of refraction, and the juxtaposed vector product form for the law of reflection.
  In particular, the exponential forms of the vector rotations enables us to take
  advantage of the addition or subtraction of exponential arguments of two rotated
  vectors in the derivation of the ray tracing invariants in cylindrical and spherical
  coordinates. We showed that the light rays inside the optical fiber trace a polygonal
  helical path characterized by three invariants that relate successive reflections
  inside the fiber: the ray path distance, the difference in axial distances, and
  the difference in the azimuthal angles. We also rederived the known generalized
  formula for the numerical aperture for skew rays, which simplifies to the standard
  form for meridional rays.'

* wrote an introduction to Geometric Algebra - an esoteric form of vector mathematics well-suited for systems under rotation and with cylindrical symmetry
* created and polished the figures under the guidance of a co-author using **AutoCAD 2010**
* performed the analytical calculations for ray tracing and obtained the expected results: the reflections of the light path as it travels along a cylindrical optical fiber traces a helix
* wrote the manuscript based on the process to obtain the results under the guidance of a co-author
* showed that it is possible to trace the optical path without resorting to reducing methods normally shown in literature (simplifying the problem using only meridional/on-axis 2D rays on a plane or using computational methods/numerical simulations)
