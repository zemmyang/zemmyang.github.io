description: This work presents results from proof-of-concept simulation of an all-dielectric nano-antenna/waveguide system and its potential application for trapping cold atoms.
abstract: Tuning the near-field using all-dielectric nano-antennas offers a promising approach for trapping atoms, which could enable strong single-atom/photon coupling. We report the simulation results of an optical trapping concept, in which a silicon nano-antenna produces a trapping potential for atoms in a chip-scale configuration. Using counter-propagating incident fields, bichromatically detuned from the atomic cesium D-lines, we numerically investigate the dependence of the nano-antenna shape and geometry on the optical potential. We show that the near-field potential landscape can be tailored by tuning the evanescent field of the waveguide.
