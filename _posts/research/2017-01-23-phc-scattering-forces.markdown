description: This paper presents a study of several periodic nanostructures, their
  capability to generate a specialized electric field, and the movement of nanoparticles
  under the influence of this field.
abstract: Electromagnetic waves are known to exert optical forces on particles through
  radiation pressure. It was hypothesized previously that electromagnetic waves inside
  left-handed metamaterials produce negative radiation pressure. Here we numerically
  examine optical forces inside left-handed photonic crystals demonstrating negative
  refraction and reversed phase propagation. We demonstrate that even though the direction
  of force might not follow the flow of energy, the positive radiation pressure is
  maintained inside photonic crystals.

* find other periodic nanostructures in literature that can generate negative refraction, scale them to the appropriate wavelength, and simulate the field propagation using **Comsol 5.1**.
* calculated the optical forces generated within these structures, and compare the results with what is expected according to mathematical analysis
* wrote part of the manuscript, detailing the results and documenting the method used in the research. generated the plots used in the paper.
* collaborated with a remote supervisor in Florida, USA, while being based in St. Petersburg.
* presented the results of the publication at two conferences (poster and oral) in Russia.
