                    <p>I am currently a second-year PhD student in Electro-optical Engineering and Optics. My research focus is in optical forces, trapping, and manipulation using fields generated from micro and nanoscale structures. I primarily perform numerical simulations using Comsol, Lumerical, and Matlab; I then analyze the data and write about the results. I also occasionally create figures for visualization.</p>

                    <p>I learn and adapt quickly to new methods and technologies. My background in scripting and programming can be easily translated to a different environment, given documentation. I am strongly interested in learning about and working with cutting edge science.
                      On the side, I enjoy 3D modeling and animation; I tinker with electronics, perform culinary experiments.
